## Description  
This is my portfolio site, which has been re-made using React for a better user experience.  This site contains my bio, a portfolio of projects that I would like to highlight professionally, and a page to contact me.

## Usage

On the Portfolio Page, if you click on a project screenshot, a modal will pop up with a link to both the GitHub Repo it is on, as well as a link to the deployed application:
